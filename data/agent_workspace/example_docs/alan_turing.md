# Alan Turing

## Overview

Alan Mathison Turing (1912-1954) was a British mathematician, computer scientist, and cryptanalyst who is widely considered the father of computer science and artificial intelligence.

## Key Contributions

- **Turing Machine**: Theoretical model of computation that became the foundation for modern computer science
- **Enigma Code Breaking**: Played a crucial role in breaking the German Enigma code during WWII at Bletchley Park
- **Turing Test**: Proposed a test for machine intelligence that remains influential today
- **Computer Design**: Helped design some of the first stored-program computers
